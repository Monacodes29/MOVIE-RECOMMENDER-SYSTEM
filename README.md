🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Python Project
📌 Project Title:
Movie Recommendation System using Python

🧠 Objective:
To develop a simple movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on content similarity (such as genre, cast, or plot keywords) using Python and basic machine learning or data analysis techniques.

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, nltk (optional), flask (for web version)

Dataset: Movie metadata (e.g., from Kaggle TMDB dataset)

🔧 How It Works:
Data Collection: Load the dataset containing information like movie titles, genres, descriptions, directors, cast, etc.

Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing nulls and duplicates, and combining relevant features (e.g., genre + keywords + cast).

Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.

Similarity Calculation: Use cosine similarity to compare movies and find similar ones.

Recommendation: Based on a user’s input (like a movie name), return the top N similar movies.

🧪 Example Workflow:
User inputs a movie name (e.g., "The Dark Knight")

The system processes and finds movies with similar descriptions, genres, etc.

Output: List of recommended movies like "Batman Begins", "Inception", etc.

🌐 Optional Features:
Add a simple Flask web app interface

Include user-based collaborative filtering (using libraries like surprise)

📈 Expected Output:
A console or web-based application that returns a list of recommended movies when a user enters a movie name.

✅ Learning Outcomes:
Understanding of recommendation system types: Content-based filtering

Hands-on practice with Python libraries for data handling and machine learning

Basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques

Optionally, introduction to web app development using Flask
